# Exercise 04 - Creating the Entity Relationship Model

>:memo: **Note:** This is an Optional Exercise

## :beginner: Detour: SAP Datasphere - Entity Relationship Model

Let us clarify what an Entity Relationship model is and why we are creating it, before we start the exercise.

An Entity Relationship Model provides a variety of benefits:
- Definition of entity-relationship models<p>
- Design physical or remote database models<p>
- Re-use existing entities (table, view) from Data Builder<p>
- Add new entities on-the-fly<p>
- In-editor real time data preview<p>
- Model Import / Export<p>

Basically, the Entity Relationship Model is not a view that you would consume in SAP Analytics Cloud, but instead it represents the relationship between the tables or views, and it helps you to define the relationship once, so that when you create a new view, that you do not have to define those relationships each time.
